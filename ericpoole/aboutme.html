        <p class="aboutmetext">        Eric Poole grew up in Hillsboro Oregon, where he spent a large amount of his time volunteering, and spending time falling in love with the great outdoors. He would love to hike bikes and do anything as long as it was outside. He had his first 50 mile backpacking experience.</p>
        <p class="aboutmetextrollout">  He also got his Ham Radio License there. He was also a large part of the scouting community there. He would network with the people in his area, and work to help younger scouts to get there merit badges. Eric Moved to a large number of places after that including California, Salt Lake City Utah, and eventually Idaho. Where he has picked up the bass. </p>
