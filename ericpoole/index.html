                Your company, I don’t know what your company will be doing, however I do know that I will be punctual, friendly, a team player, and easy to teach. Because this is how most of my past job experiences have been like. The people that don’t like me usually I like to talk to and ask how I can better help them, even if they aren’t a huge fan of my personality, we can still get along.
