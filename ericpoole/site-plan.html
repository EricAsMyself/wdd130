      <h3>Previos Employment</h3>
      <p>
        Volunteering at day camp
As part of volunteering for day camp, I worked a lot with other staff as a manager. I would work on the quality of skits, along with making sure they were appropriate for the audience. I’ve taught a wide variety of skills including Stage presence, First Aid, Paracord, and others. I work great with the team. I worked there for over 4 years. It’s where I learned that if I apply myself to my work I can enjoy work.

Working at BYU Pathway
For Brigham Young University Pathways, I worked with them to check degrees, and do quality control. I would help spot bugs for the Developers to handle, and fix. I worked with sensitive information and got very high scores. From my bosses for quality, and quantity. I made personal connections, and had comments, on my high quality emails.

Working for Walmart
For Walmart, I worked with them for six months, in the electronics department, helping people to understand the different aspects of their home network. I got very high reviews for this job, and had many people offer me money for the help that I gave them. I learned how the more that I knew the more that I could help the people around me. I asked to be trained in everything so I could help my co-workers, when they needed it.

Working for Dewey Pest Control
For Dewey Pest Control I did sales. I was a salesperson that would run door to door. It gave me a good lesson on the ability to work hard. It was often in heat greater than 100 degrees, and I would be out for 8 hours a day. It was a great job, and getting to know people was a lot of fun. It also helped me to focus on school so that I could have an indoor career. It helped me to define my future, and what I wanted to do.
