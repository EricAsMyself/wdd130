    <p> I'm from Hillsboro Oregon, I unicycle, and I like to work on networking equipment. I started my schooling in portland. There are a lot of things I miss about Oregon, mainly trees and rain, and the always warm weather. I used to work a lot with raspberry pis and any hobby I find interesting. </p>
    <p> In the picture is me and my wife. She is my main hobby. We met because her twin sister was engaged to my old roomat. Our second or third date was setting up engagment stuff for them.</p>
